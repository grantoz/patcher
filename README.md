Just a basic little React-based data filtering app for learning's sake.

TODO:

* test suite
* accessibility labels
* name a record set using ContentEditable ✅
* edit cells directly using ContentEditable ✅
* save record set to localStorage
* select record set from localStorage on application start
* auto-complete for new and updated records
* styling
  * make the load pane a modal
* optionally: connecting to suitable DB (sqlite or lowdb)
* optionally: wrapping it in an electron app
