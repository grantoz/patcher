# Patcher

Just a basic little React-based data filtering app for learning's sake, and for scratching an itch I have about keeping track of synth and plugin patches in Logic Pro.

Some of my tunes can be found on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/grantoz).

TODO:

* saving data (probably to typicode/lowdb)
* optionally: connecting to suitable DB
* perhaps wrapping it up in an electron app.
